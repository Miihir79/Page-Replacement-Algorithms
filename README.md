# CPU scheduling algorithms - OS project grp-29

This project is developed to better understand CPU scheduling algorithms by visualizing and comparing them.

### Algorithms implemented:
- FCFS
- SJF
- RR
- HRRN
- LRRN
- STRF

Pyhton based GUI using Tinker pandas matplotlib and other libraries for development.

### How to run the code?
Step 1: Clone this Github repository. <br>
Step 2: Open a CLI and navigate to this repo on your local system.<br>
Step 3: Navigate to main.py file. <br>
Step 4: Run main.py by the command python main.py.<br>
	  Youâ€™ll be presented with this interface<br>

Step 5: Press the button 'CPU Scheduling Algorithms'.<br>
Step 6: Choose any of the algorithms from the down menu present.<br>
	  Algorithms present are:<br>
	  1. FCFS<br>
  2. SJF<br>
  3. RR<br>
  4. HRRN<br>
  5. LRRN<br>
  6. STRF<br>
<br>
Step 7: After  you  select  the  algorithm  you  want  to  visualize  you  will  get  the  option  to  fill  the textbox. Enter the arrival time with a space between each input.<br>
Step 8: Enter the burst time in the same manner.<br>
Step 9: Press the button 'Visualise' for the tabular and graphical implementation of the chosen algorithm. <br>
Step 10: Press the button 'Compare All Algorithm' for the graphical representation of all the algorithms.<br>
Step 11: Press the button 'Theory'.<br>
Step 12: Press any of the buttons with the name of the algorithm on it for theoretical explaination of the same.<br>
Step 13: Press the button 'back' to return to the main window.<br>
